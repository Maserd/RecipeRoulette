Grilled Whole Fish Stuffed with Herbs and Chilies

Ingredients



1/4 cup vegetable oil, plus more for oiling the grill cage


3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided


1 (2 pound) whole tilapia, cleaned, scaled, and cut open along the belly or butterflied


2 scallions, root ends removed, cut in half lengthwise and widthwise


1 large handful cilantro (about 1 packed cup), leaves and stems


2 red Fresno chilies, thinly sliced crosswise


Special equipment:


Grill cage


Pastry brush

Heat a charcoal or gas grill until you have hot coals or high heat.

For a charcoal grill: Heat a chimney full of coals until they are grey with ash, then pile them in the center of the grill.

For a gas grill: Turn the heat to high, close the lid, and let the grill heat while you prepare the fish, about 20 minutes; the temperature should reach about 400°F.

Using a pastry brush or clean kitchen towel, oil the grill cage all over. Set aside until ready to use.

In a small jar or cup, combine the vegetable oil and 2 teaspoons of salt. Set aside to use later.

Season and rub the remaining 1 teaspoon of salt all over the inside and outside of the fish. Lay half of the scallions on the inside of the fish’s cavity, top them with cilantro, chilies, and then top the pile with the remaining scallions and close the fish. Place the fish into the oiled grill cage and close the cage.

Grill the fish over direct heat for 5 minutes, then flip the grill basket and grill the other side for an additional 5 minutes.

Use a pastry brush to coat the fish with the prepared oil (dabbing the oil through the grill cage), then grill the fish for another 30 minutes, flipping every five minutes or so and adding oil every time you flip making sure to use up all of the oil.

When finished, the fish’s skin should be partially blackened and crispy, and the flesh should be cooked through.

To check for doneness, twist the tips of two chopsticks or the tines of a fork in the flesh (while the fish is still in the grill cage); it should be flaky and opaque. If the flesh doesn’t flake easily, continue to grill the fish, flipping once, for another 10 minutes.

When the fish is fully cooked, carefully open the grill cage; the metal may stick to the fish’s skin, so you’ll want to go slowly and use your chopsticks or a butter knife to separate them when necessary.

Serve the fish whole, and let people slide a piece off of the side, without taking too many bones with it, or eat it from a communal plate at the center of the table. When one side of the fish is done, flip it to serve the other of the fish. (Everyone can also take some of the wilted herbs and chile from inside the fish, if they like.)
