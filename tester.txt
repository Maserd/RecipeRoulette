Smothered Chicken Thighs in Onion Gravy

Ingredients




2 tablespoons unbleached all-purpose flour


1 teaspoon onion powder


1 teaspoon smoked paprika


1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste


1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, to taste


1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper


1 tablespoon pure olive oil


8 (3 pounds) bone-in chicken thighs, skin removed


2 large sweet onions, chopped


3 cloves garlic, minced


3/4 cup homemade chicken stock or reduced-fat, low-sodium chicken broth, plus more if needed


2 sprigs fresh thyme


1 bay leaf


1 green onion, thinly sliced, for garnish

Preheat the oven to 350°F.

In a large shallow dish, combine the flour, onion powder, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and stir to combine.

In a large ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat, heat the oil until shimmering.

Pat the chicken thighs dry using a paper towel. Place chicken in the flour-spice mixture to coat on both sides. Shake off the excess flour (and make sure to set the flour aside, you’ll need it to make the gravy).Add the coated thighs to the pan without crowding and sear in two batches (if necessary) until golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes per side. Set chicken aside on a plate.

Add the onions to the skillet and decrease the heat to medium. Season with the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.

Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 45 to 60 seconds.

Add the remaining flour-spice mixture into the onions and stir to coat and combine. Add the chicken stock to the onion flour mixture. Stir to combine. Increase the heat to medium-high. Bring the mixture to a boil. Decrease the heat to low and simmer.

Add to the skillet the reserved chicken thighs with any accumulated juices, thyme sprigs, and the bay leaf. Nestle the thighs into the onions and turn to coat all sides in the gravy.

Transfer the skillet to the oven, uncovered, and cook until the juices of the chicken run clear when pierced with a knife and the temperature reads 165°F when inserted with an instant-read thermometer, 20 to 25 minutes.

If the gravy seems too thick, remove the chicken thighs to a serving plate and add chicken stock a little at a time. (The sauce should be thick enough to coat a spoon.)

Taste and adjust for seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve immediately.
